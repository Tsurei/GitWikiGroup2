# Shadowhound

### An Atari style 2D time-based survival game!

## Role: **Designer, Programmer, Creator**

### First Game Created within *Unity* framework!

#### Originally created as a intro project to Unity during the Fall Term and being worked on as a side project during my free time.

#### This was my first time utilizing the *Unity* framework, so although the game is only a single level at the moment, I hope to further develop levels for this project and expand more on it.
