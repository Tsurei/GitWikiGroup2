## Game Development
##### The game was built between a team of 3 programmers and 3 artists. Character Movement and abilities were my focus on this project.

### Character Movement
##### Nailing the character movement proved to require an extensive amount of testing. First tests had the character rotating instantaneosly towards the targeted direction when flicking the analog stick from one side to the other. In order to make the gameplay feel more smooth and natural, I had experimented to code the rotation in a way that the player model can be visually seen rotating towards the opposite direction instead of snapping onto that direction.
